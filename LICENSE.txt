libTerminalWx Terminal Window Widget:
https://github.com/jeremysalwen/TerminalWx.git

By Jeremy Salwen.
TerminalWx is taken (with modifications) from the Chameleon IDE (Mark
Erikson), which itself took (with modifications) from taTelnet (Derry
Bryson), which itself took (with modifications) from GTerm (Timothy
Miller).  So this code has a bit of history ;).  All credit to those
before me, the amount I've contributed is relatively nothing.
