## What is this UNSTABLE thing?

You're looking at the UNSTABLE branch for the source code for LisaEm 1.2.7. 

This branch is for the impatient who have some reason to live dangerously and want to see the new features before the next RC or Release.

Expect bugs, compilation failures, and all sorts of bad behavior.

Think of this code as you, bringing in a wild wolf into your house, and trying to teach it be a dog.

It will shred your couch, eat your cat and kids, and pee on your rug, and it will bite you despite your attempts to feed it.

It will drink and smash all your 30 year old Auchentoshan and Laphroig bottles and then burp fire.

If you're still up for trying to ride the wolf the same way Harold and Kumar did with the Cheetah, by all means, go for it! 

This is *not* a release, it's a nightmare that you'll have to build it yourself at great risk to yourself, your machines, and sanity.

Bug reports are welcome, but most likely I'm already well aware.

Arroooo!

## What is this thing?

LisaEm is a emulator that runs on a wide variety of modern and somewhat old systems by means of the wxWidgets framework, implementing an emulation of the (in)famous Apple Lisa Computer. The Apple Lisa computer is the predecessor of the Mac and the "inspiration" of many GUI environments from Windows 1.x to GEOS, GEM, VisiOn, etc. 

Many of the original ideas of the modern GUI, including copy and paste, were first envisioned in the Apple Lisa, so it's a historically very important machine. The seeds of these ideas were first found in the Xerox Alto, but the Lisa took them to their next logical step.

This document contains a few brief updates that are also found in the ChangeLog file, as well as some information on how to compile wxWidgets and LisaEm.

(The updates will go away once the bugs are removed as ChangeLog is better suited for them.)

## How do you pronounce LisaEm

The "Em" at the end of LisaEm is short for emulator, so therefore you say "Lisa" followed by the first syllable in Emulator, "Em", or if you're a native English speaker, sound out the letter M.
so: lee·suh·em,  \ ˈlē·sə·em \

Nomenclature wise, LisaEm is in line with the other Lisa related things such as Lisa Pascal Workshop, or Lisa Office System, or LisaWrite, or LisaList.
